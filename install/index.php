  <h2 class="content-subhead">How To Use This Installer:</h2>
  <p>Seeing as you're probably reading this from a browser, I'm going to assume that you've already uploaded all files and have read the steps in the ReadMe to get here - if not, <strong>go read them now!</strong>
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>Much of the info you're about to fill in can easily be changed in-game but the database configuration settings in the <code>/.env</code> file need to be populated - this installer does that for you with very little effort. </p>
  <h2 class="content-subhead">Ready To Get Started?</h2>
  <p> Simply click on "Install" in the left hand side-bar. </p>
